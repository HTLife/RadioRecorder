RadioRecorder
=============

a free radio recorder

This project is based on ffmpeg.
The goal of the project is to create a software that easily to use for everyone.
I would first put my emphasize on Mac OS X.

1. python command line tool
2. mac application
3. windows application


The feature of this software is "scheduling".
You could sechdule the record time of your favorite radio program.
